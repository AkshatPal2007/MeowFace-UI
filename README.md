# 🐱 MeowFace – Real-Time Cat Expression Mirror

**MeowFace** is a fun and intelligent project that detects your **facial emotions in real time** using your webcam and displays a **cat image matching your expression**.  
Built with **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV**, it brings AI and playfulness together through computer vision.  

---

## 🧠 Overview

Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the **FER-2013** dataset, MeowFace can recognize human facial emotions such as:
😠 Angry, 😀 Happy, 😐 Neutral and 😢 Sad 

Each emotion triggers a **corresponding cat image** that mirrors your expression — making it both entertaining and technically impressive.

### 🧠 Model Summary

The CNN used here is built with Keras Sequential API and contains multiple convolutional layers for deep feature extraction.

```bash
Conv2D(128) → MaxPooling → Dropout(0.4)
Conv2D(256) → MaxPooling → Dropout(0.4)
Conv2D(512) → Dropout(0.4)
Conv2D(512) → MaxPooling → Dropout(0.4)
Flatten → Dense(512) → Dropout(0.4) → Dense(256) → Dropout(0.3) → Dense(7, softmax)
```
